                    <h2>reviews</h2>
                     <p>if you're into anime and sport you should definitely watch haikyuu! well i wasn't really in to sport, i just gave it try cause i saw lot of posts about on my insta feed. and lemme tell i won't regret watching it. to be very honest <em>watching haikyuu was the best decision i made!</em> it's not just a sport anime, it's way more than that. haikyuu taught me a lot things about life and i'm so damn grateful to furudate-sama that he blessed us with such a great story! one thing i love the most about haikyuu is that it feels very real. just the way story revolves around  volleyball  yet it taughts you life lessons. i lovelovelove that. the animation  is great! the soundtrack fits the mood of what’s happening on screen which is excellent. it compliments and enhances every scene perfectly. the ops and eds also fit the anime really well. not to forget  the sports sounds, the squeak of the shoes on the gym floor (which is my favorite), the smack of the ball everything just makes it very realistic and perfect. the real joy comes when you get to know the charactes. haikyu manages to create a bunch of supporting characters that gives the show its flavour and at the same time they are amusing and fun to watch on screen. the characters are very believable and realistic. you might start watching it supporting karasuno but you'll end up crying for every single team in haikyuu. its crazy how those characters just touch your soul! </p> <br>

                       <h5>plot:</h5>
                       <p>the story of haikyuu is what amazes me the most. its all volleyball and yet i’m never tired of it despite not being an avid volleyball fan. the story follows hinata shoyo, a boy who desperately wants to play volleyball and become like his idol, the little giant, who played nationals for karasuno high school when he was an elementary student. however, hinata’s middle school didn’t have a volleyball team, so he spent most of his middle school life practicing on his own and in his final year he was able to participate in a tournament, thanks to his friends who became his temporary team. in his very first match he faces tobio kageyama (the king of the court) and gets stomped. that is when shoyo declares kageyama to be his rival. as fate would have it, both of them end up at karasuno high school after their final year. rivals become teammates. the volleyball team at karasuno high school has become a shadow of its former self, but with highly talented newcomers like shoyo (speed and insane spikes) and kageyama (highly precise tosses) the team once again dreams of going to the nationals.</p>
                       <br>
                        <img src="hq6.gif" alt="haikyuu" style="width:100%;"> <br> <br>
                       
                        <p> once the team starts to train together the story becomes a little predictable. they follow a tournament format, meet powerful opponents and slowly rise to the top. however, the best part of the show is how unpredictable and intense the matches are. it keeps you on the edge the whole time. the series does a great job of balancing the serious moments with comedy. </p> <br>

                        <h5>manga:</h5>
                        <p>currently haikyuu anime has only four seasons. and if you finish watching the anime, i would definitely recommend reading the manga! well, yes, everyone has their preferences and to be honest i wasn't the manga reader type but my desperate ass was so impatient to wait more for next seasons to get animated i ended up reading the manga. you can say it was my first fully read manga and i've re-read it so many times now i lost the counts. the only things i miss while reading the manga are the cute little squeak of shoes and the character voices.</p>
                        <br>
                        <img src="hq7.jpg" alt="haikyuu" style="width:100%;"><em> one of favorite pic from manga.</em><br> <br>
                        
                        
                          <p>but leaving that aside the art is so beautiful oh my gosh. wish i could draw like that. as i said the story line is perfect and please i just live for the character development in haikyuu. lemme be honest every character is so well written in haikyuu you can't argue. their character development legit slaps. and all of their passion, friendsship and love. just chefs kiss. i love all the characters dearly but i might love hinata shoyo more just a little bit. please the way he grows. he just feels so real, i love that about him. the way he inspired me to get my life together. he changed my life, made a big impact on it and i'm so grateful for that.</p> <br>
                         <img src="hq10.jpg" alt="haikyuu" style="width:100%;"><em> oni is japanese word for demon/monster, hinata and kageyama are called monsters most time.</em> <br> <br>

                        <img src="hq11.jpeg" alt="haikyuu" style="width:100%;"> <br> <br>
                        <h5><em>spoiler from manga!!</em> </h5>
                        <p> i love all the arc from the manga but i think final arc lives in my mind for rent free! i can't wait for it to get animated, gosh it's so goooood i can't even describe jsygs. i love how the manga ends. the way every character comes so far, seeing them all grown up makes you feel proud. the final arc holds a very special place in my heart. that arc changed my life. when i was reading this arc i was going through a lot at time in my life and the way hinata grew motivated me. starting all over again needs lots of courage and having such a patience, learning every single thing. that was so impactfull.</p>

                        <img src="hq5.jpg" alt="haikyuu" style="width:100%;"> <br> <br>
                        
                        <p>he taught me self love again, made me realize <em> being good means bing free. </em> i love him with all my heart oh gosh. he such a angel, my sunshine. another quote from the manga which hits as same as that is <em>if you get really good, i promise you somebody even better will come and find you</em></p>
                        <br>

                        <p> all his life kageyama wanted to play volleyball with someone better than him, and yes if feels so good watching him finally play against hinata. this is one my fav panel and i love it so much. </p>

                        <p>overall this show is amazing. if i get a chance i would go back and binge watch all the seasons again. the best part is you don’t have to love volleyball to watch this show. if you’re a fan of character development, some comedy and stylish action you’re in for a treat.</p> <br> <br>
